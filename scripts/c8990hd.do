* Modify the path below to point to your data file.      
* The specified subdirectory was not created on          
* your computer. You will need to do this.

* The stat program must be run against the specified     
* data file. This file is specified in the program       
* and must be saved separately.                          
*                                                        
* This program does not provide tab or summarize for all 
* variables.                                             
*                                                        
* There may be missing data for some institutions due    
* to the merge used to create this file.                 
*                                                        
* This program does not include reserved values in its   
* calculations for missing values.                       
*                                                        
* You may need to adjust your memory settings depending  
* upon the number of variables and records.              
*                                                        
* The save command may need to be modified per user      
* requirements.                                          
*                                                        
* For long lists of value labels, the titles may be      
* shortened per program requirements.
