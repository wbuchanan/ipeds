* The stat program must be run against the specified

* This program does not provide tab or summarize for all 
* variables.                                             
*

*                                                        
* You may need to adjust your memory settings depending  
* upon the number of variables and records.              
*                                                        
* The save command may need to be modified per user      
* requirements.                                          
*
